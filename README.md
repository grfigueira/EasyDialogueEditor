# EasyDialogEditor

**EasyDialogEditor** is a lightweight dialog tree editor for games. 

It allows you to visually create dialog trees and export them as JSON.
It is not a dialog system, but rather a way of visually creating dialog data. As such, it will work on any dialog system as long as you parse the data on your end.

It is a single portable executable with no external dependencies required.

Built with `ImGui`, `ImNodes`, and `SDL3`.

# EasyDialogEditor

EasyDialogEditor is a lightweight dialog tree editor for games. It allows you to visually create dialog trees and export them as JSON.
It is not a dialog system, but rather a way of creating dialog data. As such, it will work on any engine, framework, or dialog system as long as you parse the data on your end.

It is a single portable executable file with no external dependencies required at runtime.

Built with `ImGui`, `ImNodes`, and `SDL3`.
